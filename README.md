## Hello there!

I'm a Software Engineer interested in infrastructure and tooling. I've started programming in middle school and I've been tinkering and learning ever since. 

I love self-hosting my own infrastructure, running services and tools on my home servers. I'm passionate about deployment automation for that, and also general CI/CD for my own projects running there.

This account is used only for my public projects and any contributions. My personal projects and infrastructure is hosted on my own gitea instance.
